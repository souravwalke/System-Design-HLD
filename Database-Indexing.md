<p> A database indexing is a technique of creating a shortcut that helps the database find information faster. 
    Instead of searching through every row in a table, the index points directly to where the data is stored, saving time.</p>

Techniques of Indexing
1. Hash Indexes
2. SS Tables and LSM Trees
3. B-Trees

<h4> Hash Indexes</h4>

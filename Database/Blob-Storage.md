**Blob Storage**

**What is Blob storage and why is it used?**

Blob storage refers to storing large amounts of unstructured data, such as text, images, videos, or binary files, in an efficient, scalable, and secure manner. 

Sometimes you'll need to store large, unstructured blobs of data. This could be **images, videos, or other files**. Storing these large blobs in a **traditional database** is **expensive and inefficient** and should be avoided when possible. Instead, you should use a blob storage service like **Amazon S3 or Google Cloud Storage**.

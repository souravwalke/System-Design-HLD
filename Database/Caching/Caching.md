**Caching**

```Think of caching like keeping your favorite snacks on the kitchen counter instead of going to the pantry every time you want one. The kitchen counter (cache) is easily accessible, so you can grab your snack (data) quickly, instead of walking all the way to the pantry (database) and spending time finding it.```

**Redis vs Memcached**

**What are the similarities between Redis and Memcached?**

Redis and Memcached are popular caching technologies or tools that implement caching mechanisms. Both are widely used for their efficiency, simplicity, and scalability in handling in-memory caching.

- Both use a **key-value storage model** for simplicity and efficiency.
- Both support **sub-millisecond response times**.
- Both are syntactically **easy to use** and require a minimal amount of code to integrate into your application.
- Both allow you to distribute your data among multiple nodes.
- Both have **broad support** with libraries and clients for almost all major programming languages
- Both allow setting **Time-to-Live (TTL)** for keys, enabling automatic expiration of cached data after a specified duration.

**Why is Redis better than Memcached?**

- Redis supports a variety of rich data structures like strings, hashes, lists, sets, sorted sets, bitmaps, streams, and geospatial data. While Memcached only supports simple key-value pairs where values are plain strings.
- Redis has built-in support for clustering and replication, allowing horizontal scaling and high availability.
- Redis OSS supports transactions that let you execute a group of commands as an isolated and atomic operation.
- Redis allows you to periodically save the in-memory data to disk for archiving and recovery purposes.

**When is it best to use Memcached instead of Redis?**

Choose Memcached when you need a simple, fast, and lightweight cache for transient data or basic key-value storage, especially for read-heavy use cases where persistence and advanced features are unnecessary.

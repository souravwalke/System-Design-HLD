**MongoDB**

MongoDB is a NoSQL database that stores data in a flexible, document-oriented format instead of traditional rows and columns like relational databases. It is one of the most popular NoSQL databases in the world, widely used for modern, scalable applications.

**What are some of the best features of MongoDB?**

1. Data is stored as JSON-like documents. Each document can have its own unique structure, making it ideal for unstructured or semi-structured data.
2. MongoDB doesnâ€™t require a fixed schema, so fields in documents can vary.
3. MongoDB is designed for horizontal scaling.
4. Supports powerful querying with filters, projections, aggregations, and indexes.

**What Does Document-Style Storage Mean?**

In MongoDB, document-style storage means that data is stored as documents, which are JSON-like objects (internally stored as BSON). Each document is a self-contained, flexible data structure with fields (key-value pairs) and documents within another document do not need the same structure. This makes it different from the rigid rows and columns in a relational database.

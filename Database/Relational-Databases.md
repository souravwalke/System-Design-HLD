**Relational Databases**

**What are relational databases ?**

Relational databases are all about organizing data in **tables** and managing relationships between those tables to make querying and data management efficient. Examples: MySQL, PostgreSQL, and Oracle DB

Underlying Architecture of Relational Databases

- Uses **B-Trees** for database indexing (Speeds Up Queries and Range Updates)
- B-Trees are created automatically for primary keys and unique constraints.
- Two-phase locking is used commonly to ensure the "Isolation" of transactions.
- All reads and writes go to the disk.

**What are the shortcomings of relational databases ?**

- Doesnâ€™t scale well horizontally - Sharding a relational database adds overheads on the network making the read/write calls slower.
- 2PL makes the relational databases slower because locking involves multiple steps which adds latency.
- B-Trees makes writing slower.
- Relational databases require a fixed schema. This rigidity made it hard to adapt to dynamic and unstructured data.

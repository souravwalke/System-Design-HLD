**Lamport Timestamp** - Lamport timestamp is a simple mechanism used in distributed systems to assign a sequence of timestamps to events, ensuring a consistent logical order of events.  even if the nodes in the system do not have synchronized clocks.

**Apache Flink** is a framework and distributed processing engine for stateful computations over unbounded and bounded data streams.

-  Unbounded streams: Data streams that don't have a defined end, like continuous sensor data or clickstreams.
-  Bounded streams: Finite datasets, similar to traditional batch processing.

Use Case: Real-time data streaming applications, analytics, and event-driven systems.

**Merkle tree (also called a hash tree)** is a tree-like data structure in which every leaf node contains the hash of a data block, and every non-leaf (parent) node contains the hash of its child nodes. The root of the Merkle tree represents the complete dataset. It's a clever way of detecting differences between large sets of records.

**Staging Environment** - A staging environment is a copy of production, where you test the full system before releasing it to real users. It helps catch bugs, performance issues, or integration problems in a controlled environment. It ensures reliability before release but doesnâ€™t test with real traffic; some bugs may still appear in production.

**Canary Deployment** - Instead of releasing an update to everyone at once, a canary deployment rolls it out to a small percentage of users first. If no issues are detected, it gradually expands to more users.

**Feature Flags** - Feature flags (also called feature toggles) are a software development technique that allows you to enable or disable features without deploying new code. This allows developers to control feature rollouts dynamically.
